# Inorganic SMILES grammar

This repository contains the work for generating a model able to generate **Inorganic** SMILES using grammatical evolution.

This is achieved by readapting the code of [ChemGE](https://github.com/tsudalab/ChemGE). (Also using successive changes from [Guacamol](https://github.com/BenevolentAI/guacamol_baselines/tree/master/smiles_ga))

## Original Code 

Contains the code obtained from Guacamol
